## A Quick Word about Licensing

We set out to produce an open source library unencumbered by licenses. We hope that others will find this library useful!

This software contains code and ideas derived from works published by Robert Sedgewick related to the Red-Black Tree and the Quicksort algorithm. In the development of this work, many other works (both code and explanations) were studied. For example, a lot of time has been spent reviewing the standard template library in C++'s implementation and details of the Linux kernel. We have tried to write the code without borrowing any code or explanations from other projects, but the approaches, variable names, and etc., will likely look similar due to the amount of time that we've worked in the space. We go to great lengths to reference the authors or engineers of paradigms that inspire our work.

**Our goal is to offer a starting point to the OSS community that can be built upon!**
