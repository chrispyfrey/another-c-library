      Another C Library improves upon some of the most useful computer science algorithms from the ground up such as sorting and binary search trees while providing services such as JSON parsing and garbage collection.
    title: What?
  - body: >-
      Another C Library aims to provide an open source collection of algorithms necessary to build complex applications while making C more accessible to engineers.
    title: Why?
  - body: >-
      Another C Library works seamlessly alongside standard C, so you the great performance, powerful tooling, and extensive libraries. Include the modules you need and nothing more!
