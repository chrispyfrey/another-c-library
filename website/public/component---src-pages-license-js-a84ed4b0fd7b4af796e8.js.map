This software and documentation\n        contains code and ideas derived from works published by Robert Sedgewick relating\n        to the Red-Black Tree and the Quicksort algorithm. Many other works (both code and\n          explanations) were studied. I've spent years studying many open source\n          implementations including the details of the linux kernel, so I'm sure you\n          will see their influence in how the code is written. I have tried to write the\n          code without borrowing any code or explanations from other projects, but I'm sure\n          that approaches, variable names, etc will look similar. I've worked with brilliant\n          engineers over the years and certainly borrowed approaches from their work.\n          I will try and call out where I have learned things when it is relevant (and I\n            remember). I'm sure that there are better ways to do things and welcome help!</p>\n        <p>Throughout the eBook and documentation on this website, the following notice will\n        appear at the top of most of the files:</p>\n        <p><strong>Copyright 2019 Andy Curtis & Daniel Curtis</strong></p>\n        <p>Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n        you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n        You may obtain a copy of the License at:</p>\n        <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 <FaExternalLinkAlt /></a>\n        <br /><br />\n        <p>Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n        distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n        See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n        limitations under the License.</p>\n\n        <p>The website itself was built using React and GatsbyJS which are both licensed\n        under the MIT License.</p>\n\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default License\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
